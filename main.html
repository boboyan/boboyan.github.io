           Bobo Yan is currently a Management Information System student at the University of Nebraska Omaha. She chose this major simply 
           because she does not like writing that much. As for her career, well, she is still looking for internship opportunities.
           So far she has had interviews with two companies she really likes. She is a little nervous about the interview results, but she believes
           whatever happens, she will be just fine. 
            
            During her free time, Bobo likes to cook, walk, read, and spend time with family and friends. Since her husband is very into board gaming, Bobo plays
            boardgames as well occasionally.

            Bobo is very into graphic novels. During the winter break, Bobo has read a lot of graphic novels, and she has picked two of her favorite ones.
